    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Juan David Navarro</h2>
    <p>I'm Juan David, a 19 years old colombian with a love for soccer and tennis. Exploring different cultures give me a different perspective of life. My passion for programming sparked at 15 (Specially web development). What makes me decide to study in Canada was my english course in toronto last year because I found the beauty of this country.</p>
    <p>I hope that college can help me become a great problem solver. Helping make people's life easier through technology is my main goal with my career. Learning as much as I can is my main personal goal.</p>
